# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to migrate SSO configuration information (sso_start_url and sso_region) currently hardcoded in the sso_session.template file to the settings.toml configuration file, and implement dynamic generation of SSO session templates. This will improve configuration flexibility and maintainability, allowing users to manage different SSO environments by modifying configuration files without directly editing template files.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to be able to configure SSO session information in settings.toml, so that I can easily manage SSO configurations for different environments without modifying code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user defines SSO configuration blocks in settings.toml THEN the system should be able to read this configuration information
2. WHEN configuration contains sso_start_url and sso_region fields THEN the system should validate the validity of these fields
3. WHEN configuration supports multiple SSO sessions THEN the system should be able to handle multiple different SSO environment configurations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to automatically generate sso_session.template content based on configuration in settings.toml, so that I don't need to manually maintain template files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN system reads SSO configuration from settings.toml THEN the system should generate corresponding SSO session template content
2. WHEN generating template content THEN the system should maintain the original template format and structure
3. WHEN configuration contains multiple SSO sessions THEN the system should generate corresponding configuration blocks for each session
4. WHEN sso_registration_scopes is not specified in configuration THEN the system should use default value "sso:account:access"

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to be able to call template generation functionality through programming interfaces, so that I can dynamically use generated configurations in applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calling template generation function THEN the system should return formatted SSO session configuration string
2. WHEN configuration file doesn't exist or has format errors THEN the system should throw clear error messages
3. WHEN required configuration fields are missing THEN the system should provide meaningful error prompts

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to validate configuration completeness and correctness, so that I can discover configuration issues early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validating SSO configuration THEN the system should check if sso_start_url format is a valid URL
2. WHEN validating SSO configuration THEN the system should check if sso_region is a valid AWS region format
3. WHEN configuration validation fails THEN the system should provide specific error information and repair suggestions
4. IF configuration contains invalid fields THEN the system should warn users but not block processing
